Research groups

Interactive Systems Research Group (ISRG)
        The Interactive Systems Research Group focuses on the development of new technologies for the cognitive and physical rehabilitation of users within the real world.

Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)
        This research group brings together academics researching in the areas of computational intelligence applications.

Cognitive Computing and Brain Informatics Research Group (CCBI) 
        This research group is centred around brain research, mainly brain computer interfacing (BCI) including EEG hyper scanning, and body sensor networking (BCI)."," Excellent question! At the Centre for Computer Science and Informatics (CIRC), intelligent sensors play a crucial role in several research groups, particularly in the Cognitive Computing and Brain Informatics Research Group (CCBI). Within CCBI, researchers use intelligent sensors to develop Body Sensor Networking (BSN) systems, which enable the collection of physiological data from various parts of the human body. These sensors can detect subtle changes in brain activity, heart rate, or other vital signs, allowing researchers to better understand brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and develop more effective BCI systems.  Additionally, intelligent sensors also feature prominently in the Interactive Systems Research Group (ISRG), where they're used to create wearable devices that can track user movements, emotions, or other physical and cognitive states. This enables the development of personalized interventions for cognitive and physical rehabilitation, as well as more effective assistive technologies.  While I couldn't find any specific information on the Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group's (CIA) use of intelligent sensors, it's likely that they too leverage these sensors to collect and analyze data for their computational intelligence applications.  Overall, intelligent sensors are a key component in many of CIRC's research endeavors, enabling the development of innovative solutions that can positively impact people's lives.","['Centre for Computer Science and Informatics (CIRC)\n        Harnessing enabling technologies ranging from machine learning, AI, and advanced display technologies, to intelligent sensors and robotics to drive advances for individuals and society.\n\nResearch groups\n\nInteractive Systems Research Group (ISRG)\n        The Interactive Systems Research Group focuses on the development of new technologies for the cognitive and physical rehabilitation of users within the real world.\n\nComputational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)\n        This research group brings together academics researching in the areas of computational intelligence applications.\n\nCognitive Computing and Brain Informatics Research Group (CCBI) \n        This research group is centred around brain research, mainly brain computer interfacing (BCI) including EEG hyper scanning, and body sensor networking (BCI).']","Intelligent sensors are likely to be a part of various research activities within the Centre for Computer Science and Informatics (CIRC), particularly in the Interactive Systems Research Group, Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group, and Cognitive Computing and Brain Informatics Research Group.

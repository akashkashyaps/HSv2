Department of Computer Science
Welcome to the Department of Computer Science at NTU. The department combines internationally significant research with an outstanding record for teaching excellence. Our state-of-the-art facilities and career-focused approach to course design provide the right conditions for students to succeed in their chosen fields.
"Our undergraduate and postgraduate courses are designed to be industrially relevant with the right balance of theory and practice. The British Computing Society (BCS) have accredited all of our undergraduate degrees to Chartered IT Professional (CITP) status, and towards Chartered Engineer (CEng) status with the Engineering Council. We are a thriving department combining expertise with modern facilities and equipment to create an outstanding environment for learning and development.The strength and relevance of our teaching and research are underpinned by a healthy synergy with a network of external businesses and organisations. We have over 200 industrial placement partners, including Microsoft, GlaxoSmithKline, IBM, Schlumberger, HP, Santander and Refinitiv.Research activity within the department is wide-ranging and collaborations and funding for research have been gained from a variety of sources including Innovate UK, the EPSRC, the US Department of Homeland Security and the EU. Our research is internationally recognised, particularly in the areas of serious games, computational intelligence and security."

"If you’re just starting out and are passionate about working in computing and technology, our accredited undergraduate computing courses can help your get there."
Our research
"The Computing and Informatics Research Centre’s (CIRC) unifying and overarching research vision is ‘Enabling Digital Technology’ and is grounded in high-quality, interdisciplinary work with expertise in advanced computer science topics with links to partners from both academia and industry. The CIRC’s research is delivered by four groups."
Centre for Computer Science and Informatics (CIRC)
"Harnessing enabling technologies ranging from machine learning, AI, and advanced display technologies, to intelligent sensors and robotics to drive advances for individuals and society."
Research groups
Interactive Systems Research Group (ISRG)
The Interactive Systems Research Group focuses on the development of new technologies for the cognitive and physical rehabilitation of users within the real world.
Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)
This research group brings together academics researching in the areas of computational intelligence applications.
Cognitive Computing and Brain Informatics Research Group (CCBI)
"This research group is centred around brain research, mainly brain computer interfacing (BCI) including EEG hyper scanning, and body sensor networking (BCI)."
Cyber Security Research Group (CSRG)
The cyber security research group (CSRG) is a dynamic team of seasoned professionals dedicated to researching and implementing effective solutions to safeguard against cyber threats.
Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021
"In the latest Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021, 86% of NTU's research impact was assessed to be either world-leading or internationally excellent. The overall quality of each Unit of Assessment NTU submitted to REF in 2021 also saw an improvement from the previous REF in 2014."
Our facilities
"With over £8 million invested, our computer science students will study in facilities designed to very high specifications with a variety of electronic and communication laboratories."

That's an easy one! According to our team here at NTU, Dr. Isibor Kennedy Ihianle is indeed a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science, but I'm afraid he is not the Professor and Head of Department.

However, if you're looking for the Professor and Head of Department with over 200 industrial placement partners, including big names like Microsoft and GlaxoSmithKline, I'd be happy to help you with that!

After checking our departmental information, I found out that Professor Jon Garibaldi is actually the Head of School for Computing and Mathematics at NTU. He has an impressive track record of establishing strong industry partnerships, and his department has secured collaborations with numerous prominent companies, including Microsoft and GlaxoSmithKline, among many others.

I hope that answers your question!",4.396347761154175

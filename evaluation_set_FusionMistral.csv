Many of our students find that living at home, at least for the first year, gives them the best chance to get used to university study without having to get used to independent living at the same time. Choosing a course which suits them and is enjoyable matters, as it will reduce the inevitable pressures that arise in the process of securing a degree. Students with neurodiversities are often best served short-term and long-term when they follow their 'passions' and find a vocational niche within that area which can be nurtured.""]","Before arriving at NTU, it is important to discuss various accommodation options with your prospective student. Considering the advantages of living at home for the first year, you can explore whether they would prefer staying in a shared house or dormitory near their university campus. Additionally, discuss how choosing a course that aligns with their interests might influence their choice of accommodation, as some courses may have specific housing requirements or recommendations.",simple,"[{'source': 'CS_OpenDay_General.docx', 'filename': 'CS_OpenDay_General.docx'}, {'source': 'CS_OpenDay_General.docx', 'filename': 'CS_OpenDay_General.docx'}]",True

Be prepared for a change in the way support is delivered and arranged. At school, you may have had regular contact with a Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) and have played an active role in deciding what support was\n","\nAt school, the Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) often plays a key role in arranging and coordinating additional support for students with special educational needs or disabilities. This can include liaising with external agencies, organizing resources such as equipment or software, and providing one-to-one support if necessary.\n\nIn contrast, at universities like Nottingham Trent, the responsibility for arranging support lies more with the individual student. Students with disabilities or specific learning differences are encouraged to self-identify and discuss their needs with the Disability and Dyslexia Support Service. The service works closely with students to arrange reasonable adjustments, such as extended deadlines, alternative exam arrangements, or specialist equipment.\n\nRegarding resource funding, it's important to note that while schools may receive government funding for additional support, universities typically rely on a combination of government funding, student fees, and private donations. However, the Disability and Dyslexia Support Service at NTU works hard to ensure that students with disabilities have access to the resources they need to succeed academically.\n\nAs for personal aid, this is usually arranged on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual needs of each student. This could involve arranging for a personal assistant, sign language interpreter, or note-taker, depending on the student's requirements.\n\nIn summary, while there is a shift in responsibility for support from SENCOs to the individual student at university, the Disability and Dyslexia Support Service at NTU is committed to working closely with students to ensure they have the support they need to thrive academically."", 'source_documents': [Document(metadata={'chunk_id': 533, 'source': 'Advice for parents, guardians, and carers'}, page_content='Is support at university very different to that provided at school?

We use various sensors such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and even joint EEG-fMRI to collect brain activity data. This data is then processed to understand patterns related to conditions like seizures, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep disorders, pain, depression, etc.\n\nMachine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed to analyze these complex patterns, helping us gain insights into these conditions. For instance, we can identify abnormalities or changes in brain activity associated with certain diseases or states. This information can be crucial for developing effective rehabilitation strategies.\n\nIn terms of HCI, our goal is to create interfaces that allow individuals to interact with computers using their brain activity. For example, a person with motor disabilities could control a computer or a prosthetic limb using their thoughts. This technology has the potential to greatly improve quality of life for many people.\n\nSo, in summary, signal processing, Machine Learning, and sensors play vital roles in HCI for brain data analysis and rehabilitation, enabling us to better understand brain function, diagnose conditions, and develop innovative technologies to assist those in need.', 'source_documents': [Document(metadata={'about': 'Introduction', 'chunk_id': 175, 'source': 'CCBI'}, page_content='Brain functional data and signal (EEG, MEG, fMRI, joint EEG-fMRI) processing, understanding, and machine learning (seizure, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep, pain, depression)'), Document(metadata={'about': 'Introduction', 'chunk_id': 175, 'source': 'CCBI'}, page_content='Brain functional data and signal (EEG, MEG, fMRI, joint EEG-fMRI) processing, understanding, and machine learning (seizure, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep, pain, depression)'), Document(metadata={'about': 'Introduction', 'chunk_id': 175, 'source': 'CCBI'}, page_content='Brain functional data and signal (EEG, MEG, fMRI, joint EEG-fMRI) processing, understanding, and machine learning (seizure, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep, pain, depression)'), Document(metadata={'about': 'Introduction', 'chunk_id': 175, 'source': 'CCBI'}, page_content='Brain functional data and signal (EEG, MEG, fMRI, joint EEG-fMRI) processing, understanding, and machine learning (seizure, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep, pain, depression)')}","['Our Focus\n\nHuman-centred AI for Cognitive Computing and Brain Informatics\n\nBrain research (looking at functional, personal, behavioural, psychological and physiological disorders)\n\nBrain functional data and signal (EEG, MEG, fMRI, joint EEG-fMRI) processing, understanding, and machine learning (seizure, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep, pain, depression)\n\nBrain-computer interfacing (BCI), brain EEG hyperscanning, mental and physical rehabilitation, and rehabilitative assessment\n\nAnalysis, processing, and learning of human related data\n\nMultimodal data analysis and learning (EEG-fMRI, audio-video, medical data)\n\nBody sensor networking']","Signal processing, machine learning (ML), and sensors play crucial roles in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for brain data analysis and rehabilitation.

These methods allow for the creation of artificial data sets that mimic real-world scenarios without exposing sensitive information about individuals.\n\nIn summary, machine learning plays a crucial role in developing fall detection systems using thermal sensor arrays while preserving user privacy by focusing on relevant patterns, employing advanced computational intelligence techniques, and implementing privacy-preserving methodologies."", 'source_documents': [Document(metadata={'about': 'About the Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)', 'chunk_id': 162, 'source': 'Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)'}, page_content='Fall Detection and Privacy-preserving Human Behaviour Monitoring Through Thermal Vision - Thermal Sensor Array (TSA) in combination with appropriate Computational Intelligence techniques, can be used as an approach for a low-cost, non-contact, and privacy-preserving human behaviour monitoring.'), Document(metadata={'about': 'About the Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)', 'chunk_id': 162, 'source': 'Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)'}, page_content='Fall Detection and Privacy-preserving Human Behaviour Monitoring Through Thermal Vision - Thermal Sensor Array (TSA) in combination with appropriate Computational Intelligence techniques, can be used as an approach for a low-cost, non-contact, and privacy-preserving human behaviour monitoring.'), Document(metadata={'about': 'About the Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)', 'chunk_id': 162, 'source': 'Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)'}, page_content='Fall Detection and Privacy-preserving Human Behaviour Monitoring Through Thermal Vision - Thermal Sensor Array (TSA) in combination with appropriate Computational Intelligence techniques, can be used as an approach for a low-cost, non-contact, and privacy-preserving human behaviour monitoring.'), Document(metadata={'about': 'About the Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)', 'chunk_id': 162, 'source': 'Computational Intelligence and Applications Research Group (CIA)'}, page_content='Fall Detection and Privacy-preserving Human Behaviour Monitoring Through Thermal Vision - Thermal Sensor Array (TSA) in combination with appropriate Computational Intelligence techniques, can be used as an approach for a low-cost, non-contact, and privacy-preserving human behaviour monitoring.')}","['Signature Verification - Machine learning is often employed to detect real and forged signatures.

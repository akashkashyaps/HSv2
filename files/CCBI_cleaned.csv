welcome to cognitive computing and brain informatics
the group activity is centred around brain research mainly brain computer interfacing bci including eeg hyperscanning and body sensor networking bci for body and brain abnormality identification recently our main interest has been on seizure identification and stimulation of brain epileptogenic networks this is through developing new adaptive and cooperative signal processing model and data driven ai and single or multichannel multidimensional and multimodal biomedical signal decomposition the group activity is centred around brain research mainly brain computer interfacing bci including eeg hyperscanning and body sensor networking bci for body and brain abnormality identification recently our main interest has been on seizure identification and stimulation of brain epileptogenic networks this is through developing new adaptive and cooperative signal processing model and data driven ai and single or multichannel multidimensional and multimodal biomedical signal decomposition

signal processing machine learning and sensor networks are the major tools in biomedical data signal image and patient peripheral information understanding recognition and classification in ccbi the major research focus is on developing ground breaking approaches to
core services we offer include
developing tools and algorithms for identification classification and scoring of generative and degenerative brain states diseases and abnormalities
assisting with multimodal realtime medical data analysis for monitoring diagnosis prediction of alarming states and decision making
developing tools for braincomputer interfacing particularly for rehabilitation
developing modeldriven for data fusion data driven for deep learning and diffusion techniques for cooperative learning for ai and machine learning
speech processing for source separation human identification speech recognition and speaker identification
medical image enhancement fusion anomaly detection and diagnosis
advanced signal processing including processing of biomedical signals speech music and medical images
sensor based gait recognition
new wearable sensors can circumvent the limitations of videobased gait recognition often used for rehabilitative assessment
body sensoring network
body sensoring network
the information from wearable sensors can reveal physical behavioural and mental abnormalities and be integrated within an iot system
intracranial brain stimulation
by processing the information from multichannel electrocorticogram mat the seizure networks in deep brain can be identified and localised
localization of brain event potentials for audio stimulation
many human mental states and abnormalities can be identified by evaluating the brain responses to audio visual and haptic stimulations as the basis for braincomputer interfacing
selected partners and collaborators
the number of partners addresses ntus research strategy by focusing research and is external facing with the potential to provide high quality outputs the phd experience is significantly enhanced by providing real world high impact research projects to potential students

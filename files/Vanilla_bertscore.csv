Firstly, Machine Learning algorithms can analyze the data collected by the thermal sensor array to identify patterns associated with falls. This analysis can be done without directly observing or recording visual images of individuals, thus preserving their privacy.  Secondly, these algorithms can be trained to recognize normal behavior patterns and only flag unusual patterns that might indicate a fall. This reduces false positives and further protects individual privacy.  Thirdly, Machine Learning can be used to develop models that work locally on the device itself, rather than sending raw data to a central server for processing. This local processing helps maintain privacy by reducing the amount of sensitive data that needs to be transmitted over networks.  Lastly, techniques such as differential privacy can be employed during the training phase of the Machine Learning model to ensure that the learned patterns do not reveal any personal information about the individuals being monitored.

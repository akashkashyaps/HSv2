Advancing Knowledge — Pioneering Research Projects by our Group
Drive with Confidence
A Safe and Secure Driving System to Mitigate Remote Vehicle Hijacking Risks. The system focuses on:
The development of a secure vehicular communication system considering physical layer and protocol level security as well as network segmentation approach.
"Integrating an in-vehicle intrusion detection system using artificial intelligence to monitor the vehicle's network for suspicious activity, such as attempts to connect to the vehicle's control systems from an unauthorised connection or device."
PRAVE Project (PRoactive Authentication and Verification Embedded Model for Critical Cyber-Physical Systems).This Research and Development project will innovate a new proactive security model for protecting cyber-physical systems in the CNI using a trustworthy artificial intelligent approach. PRAVE will focus on proactive authentication and verification protocol with the involvement of some of the physical aspects from the connected smart things within the CNI.

Overview
"The Interactive Systems Research Group focuses on the development of new technologies for the cognitive and physical rehabilitation of users within the real world, and the promotion of their mental wellbeing. This is a multi-disciplinary endeavour bringing together researchers and clinicians in virtual environments, serious games, games based learning, assistive technologies, location-based services, mobile applications, robotics, health psychology and computational intelligence."
The Interactive Systems Research Group
Areas of strength:
Areas of strength:
"Serious games and virtual environments: Developing virtual environments and games for promoting cognitive and perceptual skills in people with intellectual disabilities, to change attitudes and behaviours in health and social related contexts, and for stroke rehabilitation. Assessing the efficacy of serious games in educational and health contexts to address one of the major barriers to their adoption"
Serious games and virtual environments:
"Assistive technologies: Improving the accessibility of solutions and related services, and to determine whether the latest access techniques and new interaction modalities will provide a more accessible, more exploitable and deeply embeddable approach in mainstream ICT"
Assistive technologies:
"Robotics: Investigating the role of engagement in using robots with students with profound and multiple learning disabilities, the use of assistive technologies in controlling robots and the development of intelligent multimodal systems to promote communicational skills"
Robotics:
Location-based services: Investigating the role of location-based and games technologies for route learning and the development of accurate spatial mental models and maps to develop improved confidence and abilities in independent travel for people with a wide range of impairments
Location-based services:
"User-centred design and user experience: Designing interactive systems involving users in co-design, and delivering systems, which focus on User Experience goals"
User-centred design and user experience:
"Smart devices for education: Investigating the use of tablet computers in education and developing apps and methods to integrate the use of technologies within the classroom, and in clinical practice"
Smart devices for education:

Areas of growing activity:
Using sensor data to determine personalised learning for students with cognitive impairments and autism: Our advanced learning systems analyse the affective state of learners and the non-linearity of the presentation of learning materials to influence the effectiveness of the learning process and engagement of learners
Using sensor data to determine personalised learning for students with cognitive impairments and autism
Using Games and affective state to reduce abnormal movements in home based rehabilitation for stroke patients: Our previous research has shown that adherence to exercise and accuracy of movement in unsupervised home rehabilitation settings are significant barriers to using co-designed games as tools for the rehabilitation of the upper limb and hand following stroke when formal therapies stop. We propose a novel solution: first harnessing multimodal data to assess patient state of affect and using this information to adapt game mechanics to maintain engagement and optimise adherence to exercise; and second by providing in-game feedback to encourage increasingly accurate exercise over a period of time designed with patients and therapists

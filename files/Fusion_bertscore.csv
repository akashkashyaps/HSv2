This will help them build confidence and learn time management skills.  2. Teach Basic Life Skills: Teach your child basic life skills like cooking, cleaning, shopping, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. These skills will be crucial when they move out for university.  3. Foster Independence: Gradually let go of control and allow your child to make decisions on their own. This will help them become more self-reliant.  4. Simulate University Life: If possible, simulate university life at home. This could involve setting a study timetable, encouraging them to join clubs or activities, and giving them a taste of what university life might be like.  5. Communicate Regularly: Maintain open communication with your child. Discuss their fears, expectations, and concerns about university life. This will help them feel supported and prepared.  6. Visit the University: Attend open days or tours of the university. This will give your child a chance to familiarize themselves with the campus, facilities, and staff, reducing anxiety before they start.  7. Financial Planning: Help your child understand the costs associated with university life, including tuition fees, accommodation, food, and other expenses. Teach them how to budget and manage their finances effectively.  8. Emotional Support: Be there for your child emotionally. University can be a challenging time, and it's important for them to know they have someone to turn to if they need help or advice.  9. Prepare for Emergencies: Discuss potential emergencies and how to handle them. This could include academic problems, health issues, or personal crises.  10.

This includes arranging resources, liaising with teachers, and sometimes providing direct support. They often rely on local authority funding and may also apply for external grants to secure additional resources.  In contrast, universities have dedicated disability support teams that work closely with academic departments to provide appropriate adjustments and accommodations for students with disabilities. These teams often collaborate with various funding bodies, such as Innovate UK, the EPSRC, the US Department of Homeland Security, and the EU, to secure research funding that can be used to support students with disabilities.  University disability support teams also offer services like the Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA), which provides financial assistance for non-medical helpers, assistive technology, and other reasonable adjustments. It's essential for new students to reach out to these teams during the summer before starting university to discuss their specific needs and explore what support is available.",support university different provided school prepared change way support delivered arranged school may regular contact special educational needs coordinator senco played active role deciding support required university decisions support required made student together disability officer however welcome thoughts might want share suggestions proved helpful past technology mentoring bsl study skills example need applied advance funded disabled students allowance think need personal support live independently university help dressing personal hygiene cooking cleaning cannot funded via disabled students allowances instead need contact local social services team discuss package supportxawe,"The context provided does not explicitly detail the differences in resource funding and personal aid between SENCO roles at school and university disability support collaborations.

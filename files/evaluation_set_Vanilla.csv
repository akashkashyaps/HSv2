What are the options for accomodation? Many first year students opt to live in university halls, which are large, self-catering residences. This is a good way to meet other people and makes budgeting easier as utility bills are usually included. However, larger residences don’t suit everyone."," When discussing accommodation options with your prospective student, it's essential to consider both on-campus and off-campus housing. Here are some key points to discuss:  1. On-Campus Accommodation: Discuss the benefits of living in university halls, such as meeting new people, having utilities included in the rent, and being close to campus. Mention that there are various types of accommodations available, ranging from large self-catering residences to smaller apartments.  2. Off-Campus Accommodation: Talk about the possibility of living off-campus, either in private rental properties or with host families. Highlight the advantages of living closer to home, potentially reducing travel costs and maintaining family connections.  3. Course Alignment: Emphasize the importance of choosing a course that aligns with their interests and career goals. Remind them that they can still explore different options within their chosen field during their time at NTU.  4.

Computer Science - MComp (Hons): This is a four-year Master of Computing degree. It covers topics such as programming, databases, artificial intelligence, and web technologies. Entry requirements typically include A levels or equivalent qualifications with strong grades in Mathematics and Computing subjects.  2. Computer Science - BSc (Hons): This is a three-year Bachelor of Science degree. It also covers similar topics to the MComp but over a shorter duration. Entry requirements are generally the same as for the MComp.  3. Computer Science (Games Technology) - BSc (Hons): This is a three-year Bachelor of Science degree specifically focused on game development. It covers programming, graphics, animation, AI, and game design. Entry requirements are similar to those for the other Computer Science degrees.  4. Computer Science (with foundation year) - BSc (Hons): This is a four-year course designed for students who don't have the necessary qualifications to start a standard Computer Science degree. The first year focuses on building the necessary skills before moving onto the main Computer Science curriculum.  Please note that these are general guidelines and actual entry requirements may vary. For more detailed information, I would recommend visiting the NTU website or contacting the admissions office directly.  The curriculum for each course includes a mix of theoretical and practical learning. Students will learn both the principles behind computing and how to apply them in real-world scenarios. Each course also includes opportunities for work placements, project work, and research.

Signal Processing: This step involves cleaning and preparing raw data from various sources such as Electroencephalography (EEG), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), audio, video, and other medical data. Signal processing techniques help remove noise, normalize data, and extract features that are relevant for further analysis.  2. Machine Learning: Once the data is preprocessed, machine learning algorithms can be applied to learn patterns and relationships within the data. These models can then be used for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, or anomaly detection, which are essential for monitoring, diagnosing, predicting, and making decisions based on the brain data.  3. Sensors: Sensors are devices that measure physical properties and convert them into electrical signals. In the context of brain data analysis and rehabilitation, sensors like EEG caps, wearable devices, and body sensor networks provide continuous streams of data that are analyzed using signal processing and machine learning techniques. These sensors enable real-time monitoring of brain activity, muscle movements, vital signs, and other physiological parameters, which are essential for effective rehabilitation.","['Our Focus\n\nHuman-centred AI for Cognitive Computing and Brain Informatics\n\nBrain research (looking at functional, personal, behavioural, psychological and physiological disorders)\n\nBrain functional data and signal (EEG, MEG, fMRI, joint EEG-fMRI) processing, understanding, and machine learning (seizure, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep, pain, depression)\n\nBrain-computer interfacing (BCI), brain EEG hyperscanning, mental and physical rehabilitation, and rehabilitative assessment\n\nAnalysis, processing, and learning of human related data\n\nMultimodal data analysis and learning (EEG-fMRI, audio-video, medical data)\n\nBody sensor networking']","Signal processing, machine learning (ML), and sensors play crucial roles in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for brain data analysis and rehabilitation.

Body sensoring network

The information from wearable sensors can reveal physical, behavioural, and mental abnormalities and be integrated within an IoT system."," Machine Learning contributes significantly to the development of fall detection systems using thermal sensor arrays while preserving user privacy through several ways. Firstly, Machine Learning algorithms can analyze the data collected by the thermal sensor array to identify patterns associated with falls. This analysis can be done without directly observing or recording visual images of individuals, thus preserving their privacy.  Secondly, these algorithms can be trained to recognize normal behavior patterns and only flag unusual patterns that might indicate a fall. This reduces false positives and further protects individual privacy.  Thirdly, Machine Learning can be used to develop models that work locally on the device itself, rather than sending raw data to a central server for processing. This local processing helps maintain privacy by reducing the amount of sensitive data that needs to be transmitted over networks.  Lastly, techniques such as differential privacy can be employed during the training phase of the Machine Learning model to ensure that the learned patterns do not reveal any personal information about the individuals being monitored.  In summary, Machine Learning plays a crucial role in developing fall detection systems using thermal sensor arrays while preserving user privacy by analyzing data patterns, minimizing data transmission, and employing privacy-preserving techniques.","['Signature Verification - Machine learning is often employed to detect real and forged signatures. However, robotic arms and generative models can overcome these systems and mount false-acceptance attacks. Our research results show that there are exclusive behaviours to human and robotic forgers, suggesting that a system trained wholly on human forgeries can be easily attacked by robots to gain false-positive verification.

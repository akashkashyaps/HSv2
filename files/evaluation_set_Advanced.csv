Budgeting: Help your child create a budget for groceries and other expenses. Discuss the importance of sticking to a budget and making wise financial decisions. 4. Supermarket shopping: Take your child shopping with you and encourage them to compare prices, read labels, and make informed choices. 5. Cooking together: Cooking together as a family can be a fun way to teach your child cooking skills while spending quality time together. 6. Setting realistic expectations: Understand that your child may not be an expert chef or budget planner overnight. Be patient and offer guidance as needed. 7. Practicing budgeting exercises: Have your child practice creating a budget for a week or month, and then review it together to discuss any areas that need improvement. 8.

What is the difference between MComp Computer Science and BSc Computer Science? MComp computer Science is an integrated Master's course. It includes one extra year of study after the completion of the BSc degree.

You have the option to transfer between the MComp degree and the BSc degree during the first two taught years of the course, subject to your performance and your chosen module in year two.

If you perform well there is also an opportunity to transfer to our four-year MComp (Hons) Computer Science course, which combined undergraduate and postgraduate material.

What you’ll study on the Computer Science Masters MComp (Hons) course: This course combines undergraduate and postgraduate content and is designed to cover computer science foundation subjects and then build on this foundation with postgraduate level material in the final year.

The course leader and year 3 tutor for Computer Science BSc (Hons) is Dr. Andrew Pierson, who is a Principal Lecturer in Computer Science at Nottingham Trent University.","  The main difference between MComp Computer Science and BSc Computer Science courses lies in their structure and duration.  An MComp Computer Science is an integrated Master's course, meaning it includes one additional year of study after the completion of the BSc degree. This extra year provides more advanced and specialized topics compared to the BSc course.  In terms of structure, the MComp course builds upon the foundations established in the BSc degree and adds postgraduate-level material in the final year. There is an option to transfer between the MComp degree and the BSc degree during the first two taught years of the course, subject to your performance and your chosen module in year two.  If you perform well, there is also an opportunity to transfer to the four-year MComp (Hons) Computer Science course, which combines undergraduate and postgraduate material.  On the other hand, a BSc Computer Science typically takes three years to complete, focusing on foundational topics in computer science.  In summary, while both courses cover similar topics, the MComp course offers a more comprehensive and specialized education, taking four years to complete.","[""Can I change my course?

support needs often have worries about how their student will settle in and cope with the university life, so we have also included information about the help available for both general or specialist support. We encourage students to build their own resilience and to prepare for life after"," Student Support Services play a crucial role in assisting parents, guardians, and carers with their student's transition into higher education at NTU. They offer various resources and guidance to help parents and carers better understand the university environment and support their student during this critical period. Some key aspects of Student Support Services include:  1. Providing information about the university, its facilities, and resources, helping parents and carers feel more comfortable with the transition. 2. Offering advice on how to best support their student during their time at university, including tips on study habits, time management, and navigating campus life. 3. Addressing common concerns that parents and carers may have, such as financial aid, housing, and academic support services. 4. Encouraging parents and carers to work closely with the university to resolve any issues that may arise, fostering a collaborative relationship between the university, the student, and their support network. 5. Offering resources specifically tailored to students with disabilities and learning differences, ensuring that these students receive the necessary accommodations and support to succeed in their studies. 6. Providing guidance on how to prepare for the transition to university, encouraging parents and carers to support their student in building resilience and independence. 7. Offering workshops and events for parents and carers, providing opportunities to connect with other families and learn more about the university experience.

You will learn core skills concerning the production of computer programs and applications, as well as specialist knowledge in areas such as software engineering and analysis and design."," Students typically intern during their third year of study, although a placement year may be taken between the second and third years as well. The internship provides students with real-world experience, helping them apply the theoretical knowledge they have gained during their studies. This practical experience can enhance their employability and give them a better understanding of the industry, which can in turn inform their final year project and dissertation. The internship can also provide valuable networking opportunities and potentially lead to job offers upon graduation.","[""Will students fall behind academically if they go on placement? It is very unlikely that students will fall behind if they go on a placement. Placements are only approved if they are directly related to the student's course of study. We expect our placement students to learn industry-relevant technical and soft skills, some of which may be more advanced than what they would encounter at university. We also provide students with the opportunity to achieve a Level 5 Diploma in Professional Practice. This is a piece of coursework due in after the placement (but before final year) and consists of a work log, a report on their professional development, and a presentation. The Diploma allows students to practice their academic writing and presenting skills before they start their final year. The coursework they will have in final year will contain quite a lot of academic writing, so it is a good opportunity for them to get back into university-style work.""]","Students typically go on placement during their course of study rather than at a specific time like an internship would be scheduled. The context suggests that going on placement is unlikely to cause students to fall behind academically, as it is directly related to their studies and designed to enhance their skills. Placements are expected to provide industry-relevant technical and soft skills, which may even prepare them better for the academic writing and presenting required in final year studies.",multi_context,"[{'source': 'CS_OpenDay_General.docx', 'filename': 'CS_OpenDay_General.docx'}]",True

Visit the Campus: If possible, arrange a visit to the university campus. This can help familiarize your child with the environment and reduce anxiety about the move.  4. Connect with University Services: Familiarize yourself with the university's support services, such as disability services, counseling services, and student support services. Share this information with your child.  5. Communicate Regularly: Keep in touch with your child during their first year, but also encourage them to solve problems independently. This helps them build confidence and self-reliance.  6. Be Supportive: Understand that the transition to university can be challenging. Be there to offer emotional support and advice when needed.  7. Advocate for Additional Support: If your child has a disability or learning difference, advocate for appropriate accommodations and support services from the university.  8. Prepare for Transition: Encourage your child to attend orientation events, join clubs and societies, and connect with other students to build a supportive network.  9. Foster Resilience: Teach your child to view challenges as opportunities for growth and resilience. This mindset will serve them well during their university years and beyond.  10. Trust the Process: Remember that the transition to university is a significant step in your child's life.

Lack of independent living skills is all too often the"," In a school setting, the decision-making process regarding support for students with additional needs is often more structured and involves close collaboration between the student, their parents or carers, and the Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO). The SENCO plays an active role in determining what support is necessary and appropriate for each individual student.  On the other hand, in a university setting, the focus shifts towards independent learning and decision-making. Students are encouraged to take ownership of their academic journey and make informed decisions about the support they require. This shift can sometimes cause confusion for parents and carers, who may not be aware that such support exists or how to access it.  It's essential for universities to ensure that students with additional needs are made aware of the support available to them, and that they feel empowered to seek out this support when needed. Many students find that living at home during their first year can help them adjust to university life without having to deal with the added challenge of independent living at the same time.  Ultimately, the goal is for students to build their own resilience and prepare for life after university, which requires a proactive approach to seeking out and utilizing available resources.","['Is support at university very different to that provided at school?

and exam arrangements, Accessibility, Academic liaison","  In general, the support provided at university differs significantly from that provided at school, especially for students with disabilities. Here are some key differences:  1. Independent Learning: Higher education is based on the idea of independent learning, where students are expected to manage their own studies and seek help when necessary. This is a significant shift from the more structured and guided learning environment found in schools.  2. Support Structure: In universities, there are specific departments dedicated to supporting students with disabilities, such as Disability and Inclusion Services. These departments offer a wide range of support, including academic liaison, exam arrangements, accessibility assistance, and advice on applying for Disabled Students' Allowances (DSAs).  3. Self-Advocacy: Students with disabilities in higher education are often encouraged to self-advocate, meaning they are responsible for communicating their needs to their lecturers, tutors, and other university staff. This can be a challenging transition for some students, but it helps build essential life skills.  4. Access Statements: Students with disabilities are required to submit an access statement outlining their needs to the university. This document is used to arrange reasonable adjustments to ensure equal opportunities for all students.  5. Monitoring: Unlike in schools, where progress is often closely monitored, higher education is based on the principle of trust and independence. However, universities still provide support and guidance to help students succeed.  6. Attitude Towards Disability: Universities strive to create inclusive environments where students with disabilities are respected and valued for their unique qualities. There is a growing awareness and understanding of various disabilities, and many universities have policies and procedures in place to support students with disabilities.  7. Transition Support: Universities often provide transition support for students with disabilities, helping them adjust to the new environment and offering guidance on managing their studies effectively. This support can include one-to-one meetings, study skills workshops, and peer mentoring schemes.","['Is support at university very different to that provided at school?

Communication: Establish open lines of communication between the school, university, and the student. Share relevant information about the student's needs, accommodations, and support mechanisms that have been effective in the past.  2. Preparation: Encourage the student to become familiar with the university's resources and support services, such as disability services, academic advising, and counseling centers. They should learn how to access these resources and understand what kind of assistance they can expect.  3. Transition Planning: Work with the school and university to create a comprehensive transition plan that outlines the steps needed to ensure a successful transition. This may include arranging meetings with key personnel at the university, visiting the campus, and discussing accommodation options.  4. Self-Advocacy Skills: Help the student develop self-advocacy skills so they can effectively communicate their needs to professors, classmates, and university staff members. This includes understanding their rights, knowing how to request accommodations, and being assertive in advocating for themselves.  5. Collaboration: Foster collaboration between the school, university, and the student to ensure a coordinated approach to meeting the student's needs. This may involve regular check-ins, progress reports, and adjustments to the transition plan as needed.  6. Parental Support: Continue providing emotional support and encouragement while allowing the student to gradually take on more responsibility for managing their own needs. This balance helps promote independence while ensuring ongoing support when needed.  7. Training and Workshops: Attend workshops or training sessions offered by the university to better understand the specific accommodations and support services available for students with disabilities and learning differences.

This includes identifying the needs of students, liaising with teachers and other professionals, and arranging appropriate resources and support.  In contrast, at universities like Nottingham Trent University (NTU), the responsibility for identifying and providing support for students with disabilities lies primarily with the Disability Officer. The Disability Officer works closely with the student to assess their needs, recommend reasonable adjustments, and arrange necessary resources and support.  One key difference between SENCO roles and university disability support collaboration is the funding aspect. At school, the SENCO often coordinates the application process for various funding schemes, such as the Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA), to help cover the costs of additional support and resources. At university, students are typically responsible for applying for DSAs themselves, although the Disability Officer can provide guidance throughout the process.  Regarding personal aid, both SENCOs and Disability Officers work to identify and arrange suitable support for students. This could include things like note-takers, sign language interpreters, or readers for visually impaired students.

Many human mental states and abnormalities can be identified by evaluating the brain responses to audio, visual, and haptic stimulations as the basis for brain-computer interfacing.","  In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for brain data analysis and rehabilitation, signal processing, Machine Learning (ML), and sensors play crucial roles.  1. Signal Processing: Brain signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and other neurophysiological signals are complex and noisy. Signal processing techniques help to clean, filter, and transform these raw signals into a format that can be analyzed effectively. This includes methods like Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and others.  2. Machine Learning: Machine Learning algorithms are used to learn patterns and relationships within the processed brain signals. These models can help identify normal brain activity, detect abnormalities, and even predict certain conditions such as seizures, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep disorders, pain, depression, and others. Examples of ML techniques include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Deep Learning models.  3. Sensors: Sensors are essential for collecting the raw data required for signal processing and ML analysis. They can range from simple electrodes for EEG recordings to more complex devices like fMRI scanners. Wearable technology and body sensor networks are becoming increasingly important for continuous, real-time monitoring of brain activity during daily life.  These components work together to enable the development of assistive technologies, improve accessibility, and promote mental wellbeing. They also contribute to the creation of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for rehabilitation purposes, allowing for direct communication between the brain and external devices.","['Our Focus\n\nHuman-centred AI for Cognitive Computing and Brain Informatics\n\nBrain research (looking at functional, personal, behavioural, psychological and physiological disorders)\n\nBrain functional data and signal (EEG, MEG, fMRI, joint EEG-fMRI) processing, understanding, and machine learning (seizure, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep, pain, depression)\n\nBrain-computer interfacing (BCI), brain EEG hyperscanning, mental and physical rehabilitation, and rehabilitative assessment\n\nAnalysis, processing, and learning of human related data\n\nMultimodal data analysis and learning (EEG-fMRI, audio-video, medical data)\n\nBody sensor networking']","Signal processing, machine learning (ML), and sensors play crucial roles in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for brain data analysis and rehabilitation.

Quantum computers have the ability to process vast amounts of data much quicker than classical computers due to their quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This could enable financial institutions to analyze large datasets, such as market trends and customer behavior, more efficiently, leading to improved predictions and informed decisions. Additionally, quantum computing's potential for better optimization and simulation capabilities could help in developing sophisticated financial models and strategies. However, it's important to note that quantum computing technology is still in its early stages, and practical applications are currently limited. As the technology matures, we can expect to see more significant impacts on various industries, including finance.","['Quantum Intelligence Research - We recognise the great potential of the massive parallelism provided by Quantum Computing in the near future.

Body sensor networking"," In biomedical research and rehabilitation, brain-computer interfacing (BCI) plays a significant role. BCI allows for direct communication between the brain and external devices, bypassing traditional neural impulses. This technology can be used to monitor, diagnose, predict, and make decisions based on real-time medical data analysis.  One application of BCI is in rehabilitation, where it can help improve accessibility of solutions and related services. It can also determine whether the latest access techniques and new interaction modalities will provide a more accessible, more exploitable, and deeply embeddable approach in mainstream Information and Communication Technology (ICT).  Another area where BCI is useful is in identifying and understanding various brain responses to different stimuli, such as seizures, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep, pain, depression, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease. By analyzing these responses, researchers can gain insights into these conditions and potentially develop new treatments or interventions.  Additionally, BCI can be used for brain-computer interfacing (BCI), brain EEG hyperscanning, mental and physical rehabilitation, and rehabilitative assessment. This includes the analysis, processing, and learning of human-related data, multimodal data analysis and learning (such as EEG-fMRI, audio-video, and medical data), body sensor networking, and understanding various brain functions and disorders.  Overall, BCI is a valuable tool in biomedical research and rehabilitation, offering potential for improved diagnostics, treatment, and quality of life for those affected by neurological conditions.","['Signal processing, machine learning, and sensor networks are the major tools in biomedical data (signal, image, and patient peripheral information) understanding, recognition, and classification.

These techniques can identify changes in body temperature patterns that may indicate a fall, without requiring direct visual access to the individual. This approach ensures privacy preservation since no personal identifying information is required for the analysis. Additionally, transfer learning and generative adversarial networks (GAN) can be utilized to further enhance the accuracy of the fall detection system while maintaining privacy.","['Signature Verification - Machine learning is often employed to detect real and forged signatures.

AI-generated images have rapidly improved recently, and the ability to detect them is becoming a critical necessity to ensure the authenticity and trustworthiness of image data. AI models have even beaten humans in art competitions!"," In the research on signature verification using machine learning, it was found that there are unique behaviors that differentiate human and robotic forgers. These differences include:  1. Robotic forgers tend to exhibit more consistent and uniform strokes compared to human forgers, who often vary their stroke patterns. 2. Human forgers may incorporate subtle errors or inconsistencies in their forgeries, while robotic forgeries are typically more precise and error-free. 3. Robotic forgers may struggle to replicate certain aspects of handwriting, such as pressure variations, slant, and curvature, which are easier for human forgers to imitate. 4. Robotic forgeries may also lack the natural flow and rhythm that is characteristic of human handwriting. 5. Robotic forgeries may leave telltale signs of the technology used, such as small inconsistencies or anomalies that would not be present in a genuine signature.  These findings suggest that a system trained solely on human forgeries could potentially be vulnerable to attack by robots, whereas a system designed to recognize both human and robotic forgeries would be more robust.","['Signature Verification - Machine learning is often employed to detect real and forged signatures.

and disability. It is an affiliated conference to the International Society of Virtual Rehabilitation.","  Assistive robotics can play a significant role in enhancing independent living for older adults. Here are some examples of its applications:  1. Home Monitoring: Sensor networks can be installed in homes to monitor the behavior of older adults, ensuring their safety and well-being. These sensors can detect unusual patterns, such as prolonged periods of inactivity, falls, or abnormal vital signs, and alert caregivers or family members if necessary.  2. Assistive Solutions for Mild Cognitive Impairment: Robots can be designed to help individuals with mild cognitive impairment perform everyday tasks, such as remembering medication schedules, navigating around the house, or reminding them of important appointments.  3. Assistive Robotics Application for Independent Living: Robots can be used to help with various aspects of daily life, such as lifting objects, preparing meals, or providing companionship. For example, a robot could be programmed to help an elderly person get dressed, pick up items they've dropped, or even play games to stimulate cognitive function.  4. Assistive Robotics for Communication Skills: Robots can be used to help individuals with communication difficulties, such as those with autism or stroke victims, to improve their communication skills. By interacting with a robot, individuals can practice social interactions, learn new vocabulary, and improve their ability to express themselves.  5. Robot Dogs: Small, friendly robot dogs can provide companionship and help with simple tasks, such as retrieving items or guiding individuals around the house.

Body sensor networking","  Body sensor networking plays a significant role in Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) for identifying and stimulating brain epileptogenic networks. It involves the use of various sensors placed on the body to collect physiological data such as heart rate, skin conductance, and muscle activity. This data is then analyzed to identify patterns or anomalies that may indicate the presence of epileptic activity in the brain.  In the case of stimulation, these sensors can also be used to deliver electrical or magnetic stimuli to specific areas of the brain, potentially helping to control seizures or modify neural activity. This is particularly useful in the context of BCI, as it allows for non-invasive intervention and monitoring of brain activity.  At Nottingham Trent University's Interactive Systems Research Group, researchers are actively working on developing new adaptive and cooperative signal processing, model and data-driven AI, and single- or multi-channel, multi-dimensional, and multimodal biomedical signal decomposition methods for BCI and body sensor networking. These efforts aim to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of seizure identification and stimulation of brain epileptogenic networks.","['The Group activity is centred around brain research, mainly brain computer interfacing (BCI) including EEG hyperscanning, and body sensor networking (BCI) for body and brain abnormality identification.

Localization of brain event potentials for audio stimulation"," Single- and multi-channel, multi-dimensional, and multimodal biomedical signal decomposition plays a crucial role in advancing healthcare technology, particularly in the context of brain computer interfacing (BCI) for seizure identification and stimulation of epileptogenic networks.  This technique allows for the decomposition of complex biomedical signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, into simpler components. By analyzing these individual components, researchers can identify patterns associated with specific brain activities, including seizure activity.  In the case of BCI for seizure identification, these patterns can help in early detection and warning systems for patients with epilepsy. For stimulation, the decomposition can help in targeting specific regions of the brain responsible for epileptic activity, potentially reducing the severity and frequency of seizures.  Moreover, the multi-dimensional and multimodal aspect of this technique enables the integration of various types of data, such as EEG, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG), providing a more comprehensive understanding of brain activity. This integrated approach can lead to more accurate and effective BCI systems for seizure management.","['The Group activity is centred around brain research, mainly brain computer interfacing (BCI) including EEG hyperscanning, and body sensor networking (BCI) for body and brain abnormality identification.

Group Leader: Professor David J Brown is the leader for the Interactive Systems Research Group (ISRG)","  Seminars and workshops in the context of interactive learning are smaller sessions led by an academic, providing an opportunity for a group of students to debate and discuss learning topics in a more informal and interactive setting. They are designed to encourage active participation, critical thinking, and collaboration among students.  In contrast to traditional lectures, seminars and workshops typically involve fewer students, allowing for more individual attention and discussion. These sessions may focus on specific topics, case studies, or current research, and often require students to prepare beforehand by reading relevant materials.  While lectures aim to give a broad overview of a subject and provide a framework for structuring learning, seminars and workshops allow students to delve deeper into specific aspects of the topic, ask questions, and engage in discussions with fellow students and the instructor.","['Types of Learning: Lectures â€“ delivered by an academic and held in lecture theatres or classrooms, the purpose of lectures is to give a framework to structure your learning around.

3: GET TO KNOW YOUR COURSE: Attend a subject talk, get hands-on experience in a taster session, and visit your subject hub to chat with academics and current students.","  In an academic setting, lectures, seminars, and workshops serve different purposes. Lectures are typically large, formal presentations delivered by an academic, aimed at giving a broad overview of a topic and providing a framework for further study. They are usually held in lecture theaters or classrooms and can be intimidating for students who are not accustomed to this format.  On the other hand, seminars and workshops are smaller, interactive sessions where a group of students gather, often led by an academic, to debate and discuss specific topics in greater depth. These sessions offer opportunities for students to ask questions, share ideas, and engage in discussions. They are designed to be interactive and promote active learning.  Independent research is another essential aspect of higher education, where students are expected to conduct preparatory reading for most lectures and seminars, prepare coursework, and carry out independent study such as reading textbooks and lecture notes. Practical sessions and workshops may also be included, where students meet with their lecturers in small groups to discuss problems or work through challenging topics. The rest of their time is spent on independent study.  In summary, while lectures provide a broad overview of a topic, seminars and workshops facilitate deeper engagement and discussion, and independent research allows students to delve deeper into the subject matter on their own.","['Types of Learning: Lectures â€“ delivered by an academic and held in lecture theatres or classrooms, the purpose of lectures is to give a framework to structure your learning around.

Text:"," At Nottingham Trent University, students with autism spectrum conditions may face various challenges such as anxiety and stress, concentration difficulties, time management issues, and establishing an appropriate study environment. Specialist mentoring aims to address these barriers by providing one-on-one support tailored to each student's unique needs.  Mentors help students with autism develop independent learning skills by working closely with them to create personalized study plans, setting achievable goals, and offering guidance on effective study strategies. They also assist students in managing their time effectively, organizing their workload, and prioritizing tasks.  In terms of achieving a healthy work-life balance, mentors offer advice on self-care, stress management, and coping mechanisms. They also encourage students to participate in social activities, such as the weekly lunch club, to help build relationships and improve overall well-being.  Moreover, mentors collaborate with other support services at the university, such as the Disability Officer, to ensure that students with autism receive the necessary accommodations during exams and transitions. Transition support for applicants helps students prepare for university life and feel more comfortable adjusting to a new environment.  By providing ongoing support and fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment, specialist mentors aim to help students with autism spectrum conditions thrive academically and personally at Nottingham Trent University.","['We have a Disability Officer dedicated to working with students with an autism spectrum condition.

This information tells you about the role that you can play in supporting your student as they move into higher education. In Student"," At universities, such as Nottingham Trent University, the approach to teaching and learning is often more independent compared to schools or colleges. While schools or colleges have a structured timetable and learning is closely monitored, universities encourage self-directed learning. This means that students are expected to manage their own study schedules, attend lectures, seminars, and workshops, and complete assignments and projects according to deadlines.  In addition, university teaching methods may include larger classes, lectures in lecture theaters, and smaller sessions known as seminars or workshops, where students get together to debate and discuss learning. These sessions are designed to be interactive. Furthermore, students are expected to conduct preparatory reading for most topics, which is known as independent research.  This shift towards more independent learning is aimed at developing students' skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, and self-motivation, which are essential for success in higher education and beyond.","['What are the main differences between school or college and university?

facilities at our City and Clifton campuses","  First-year students at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) typically have several accommodation options available to them. Here are some of the most common ones:  1. University Halls: These are large, self-catering residences located near the university campuses. They offer a convenient way for students to meet others and manage their budgets since utility bills are usually included.  2. Private Rented Accommodation: Some students choose to rent a room in a shared house or even a flat on their own. This can be an expensive option, but it offers more independence.  3. Living at Home: Some students prefer to commute from their homes to the university.

An MComp Computer Science is an integrated Master's course, meaning it includes one additional year of study after the completion of the BSc degree. This extra year provides more advanced and specialized topics compared to the BSc course.  In terms of structure, the MComp course builds upon the foundations established in the BSc degree and adds postgraduate-level material in the final year. There is an option to transfer between the MComp degree and the BSc degree during the first two taught years of the course, subject to your performance and your chosen module in year two.  If you perform well, there is also an opportunity to transfer to the four-year MComp (Hons) Computer Science course, which combines undergraduate and postgraduate material.  On the other hand, a BSc Computer Science typically takes three years to complete, focusing on foundational topics in computer science.  In summary, while both courses cover similar topics, the MComp course offers a more comprehensive and specialized education, taking four years to complete.",change course common first term students relatively easy switch courses first term students computer science courses common first year even change courses first year studies example possible switch cyber security computer science first term computer science ai computer science games tech first year please consult course leader specific answernnwhat difference mcomp computer science bsc computer science mcomp computer science integrated masters course includes one extra year study completion bsc degree,"MComp Computer Science is an integrated Master's course that includes one extra year of study after completing the BSc degree.

decision-making process regarding support for students with additional needs is often more structured and involves close collaboration between the student, their parents or carers, and the Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO). The SENCO plays an active role in determining what support is necessary and appropriate for each individual student.  On the other hand, in a university setting, the focus shifts towards independent learning and decision-making. Students are encouraged to take ownership of their academic journey and make informed decisions about the support they require. This shift can sometimes cause confusion for parents and carers, who may not be aware that such support exists or how to access it.  It's essential for universities to ensure that students with additional needs are made aware of the support available to them, and that they feel empowered to seek out this support when needed. Many students find that living at home during their first year can help them adjust to university life without having to deal with the added challenge of independent living at the same time.  Ultimately, the goal is for students to build their own resilience and prepare for life after university, which requires a proactive approach to seeking out and utilizing available resources.",support university different provided school prepared change way support delivered arranged school may regular contact special educational needs coordinator senco played active role deciding support required university decisions support required made student together disability officer however welcome thoughts might want share suggestions proved helpful past technology mentoring bsl study skills example need applied advance funded disabled students allowance think need personal support live independently university help dressing personal hygiene cooking cleaning cannot funded via disabled students allowances instead need contact local social services team discuss package supportxawe,"At school, students may have had regular contact with a Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) and actively participated in deciding what support was needed.

at university differs significantly from that provided at school, especially for students with disabilities. Here are some key differences:  1. Independent Learning: Higher education is based on the idea of independent learning, where students are expected to manage their own studies and seek help when necessary. This is a significant shift from the more structured and guided learning environment found in schools.  2. Support Structure: In universities, there are specific departments dedicated to supporting students with disabilities, such as Disability and Inclusion Services. These departments offer a wide range of support, including academic liaison, exam arrangements, accessibility assistance, and advice on applying for Disabled Students' Allowances (DSAs).  3. Self-Advocacy: Students with disabilities in higher education are often encouraged to self-advocate, meaning they are responsible for communicating their needs to their lecturers, tutors, and other university staff. This can be a challenging transition for some students, but it helps build essential life skills.  4. Access Statements: Students with disabilities are required to submit an access statement outlining their needs to the university. This document is used to arrange reasonable adjustments to ensure equal opportunities for all students.  5. Monitoring: Unlike in schools, where progress is often closely monitored, higher education is based on the principle of trust and independence. However, universities still provide support and guidance to help students succeed.  6. Attitude Towards Disability: Universities strive to create inclusive environments where students with disabilities are respected and valued for their unique qualities. There is a growing awareness and understanding of various disabilities, and many universities have policies and procedures in place to support students with disabilities.  7. Transition Support: Universities often provide transition support for students with disabilities, helping them adjust to the new environment and offering guidance on managing their studies effectively. This support can include one-to-one meetings, study skills workshops, and peer mentoring schemes.",support university different provided school prepared change way support delivered arranged school may regular contact special educational needs coordinator senco played active role deciding support required university decisions support required made student together disability officer however welcome thoughts might want share suggestions proved helpful past technology mentoring bsl study skills example need applied advance funded disabled students allowance think need personal support live independently university help dressing personal hygiene cooking cleaning cannot funded via disabled students allowances instead need contact local social services team discuss package supportxawe,"The support provided at university differs from that at school in several ways, especially for students with disabilities.

Preparation: Encourage the student to become familiar with the university's resources and support services, such as disability services, academic advising, and counseling centers. They should learn how to access these resources and understand what kind of assistance they can expect.  3. Transition Planning: Work with the school and university to create a comprehensive transition plan that outlines the steps needed to ensure a successful transition. This may include arranging meetings with key personnel at the university, visiting the campus, and discussing accommodation options.  4. Self-Advocacy Skills: Help the student develop self-advocacy skills so they can effectively communicate their needs to professors, classmates, and university staff members. This includes understanding their rights, knowing how to request accommodations, and being assertive in advocating for themselves.  5. Collaboration: Foster collaboration between the school, university, and the student to ensure a coordinated approach to meeting the student's needs. This may involve regular check-ins, progress reports, and adjustments to the transition plan as needed.  6. Parental Support: Continue providing emotional support and encouragement while allowing the student to gradually take on more responsibility for managing their own needs. This balance helps promote independence while ensuring ongoing support when needed.  7.

one one study skills support access academic support within ntu eg library study support implement reasonable adjustments recommended evidence,"  At school, the Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) plays a significant role in coordinating support for students with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND). This includes identifying the needs of students, liaising with teachers and other professionals, and arranging appropriate resources and support.  In contrast, at universities like Nottingham Trent University (NTU), the responsibility for identifying and providing support for students with disabilities lies primarily with the Disability Officer. The Disability Officer works closely with the student to assess their needs, recommend reasonable adjustments, and arrange necessary resources and support.  One key difference between SENCO roles and university disability support collaboration is the funding aspect. At school, the SENCO often coordinates the application process for various funding schemes, such as the Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA), to help cover the costs of additional support and resources. At university, students are typically responsible for applying for DSAs themselves, although the Disability Officer can provide guidance throughout the process.  Regarding personal aid, both SENCOs and Disability Officers work to identify and arrange suitable support for students. This could include things like note-takers, sign language interpreters, or readers for visually impaired students. However, the specific arrangements may vary depending on the individual needs and circumstances of the student.",support university different provided school prepared change way support delivered arranged school may regular contact special educational needs coordinator senco played active role deciding support required university decisions support required made student together disability officer however welcome thoughts might want share suggestions proved helpful past technology mentoring bsl study skills example need applied advance funded disabled students allowance think need personal support live independently university help dressing personal hygiene cooking cleaning cannot funded via disabled students allowances instead need contact local social services team discuss package supportxawe,"The context provided does not explicitly detail the differences in resource funding and personal aid between SENCO roles at school and university disability support collaborations.

(ML), and sensors play crucial roles.  1. Signal Processing: Brain signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and other neurophysiological signals are complex and noisy. Signal processing techniques help to clean, filter, and transform these raw signals into a format that can be analyzed effectively. This includes methods like Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and others.  2. Machine Learning: Machine Learning algorithms are used to learn patterns and relationships within the processed brain signals. These models can help identify normal brain activity, detect abnormalities, and even predict certain conditions such as seizures, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep disorders, pain, depression, and others. Examples of ML techniques include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Deep Learning models.  3. Sensors: Sensors are essential for collecting the raw data required for signal processing and ML analysis. They can range from simple electrodes for EEG recordings to more complex devices like fMRI scanners. Wearable technology and body sensor networks are becoming increasingly important for continuous, real-time monitoring of brain activity during daily life.  These components work together to enable the development of assistive technologies, improve accessibility, and promote mental wellbeing. They also contribute to the creation of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for rehabilitation purposes, allowing for direct communication between the brain and external devices.",focusnnhumancentred ai cognitive computing brain informaticsnnbrain research looking functional personal behavioural psychological physiological disordersnnbrain functional data signal eeg meg fmri joint eegfmri processing understanding machine learning seizure dementia autism mental fatigue sleep pain depressionnnbraincomputer interfacing bci brain eeg hyperscanning mental physical rehabilitation rehabilitative assessmentnnanalysis processing learning human related datannmultimodal data analysis learning eegfmri audiovideo medical datannbody sensor networking,"Signal processing, machine learning (ML), and sensors play crucial roles in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for brain data analysis and rehabilitation.

research and rehabilitation, brain-computer interfacing (BCI) plays a significant role. BCI allows for direct communication between the brain and external devices, bypassing traditional neural impulses. This technology can be used to monitor, diagnose, predict, and make decisions based on real-time medical data analysis.  One application of BCI is in rehabilitation, where it can help improve accessibility of solutions and related services. It can also determine whether the latest access techniques and new interaction modalities will provide a more accessible, more exploitable, and deeply embeddable approach in mainstream Information and Communication Technology (ICT).  Another area where BCI is useful is in identifying and understanding various brain responses to different stimuli, such as seizures, dementia, autism, mental fatigue, sleep, pain, depression, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease. By analyzing these responses, researchers can gain insights into these conditions and potentially develop new treatments or interventions.  Additionally, BCI can be used for brain-computer interfacing (BCI), brain EEG hyperscanning, mental and physical rehabilitation, and rehabilitative assessment. This includes the analysis, processing, and learning of human-related data, multimodal data analysis and learning (such as EEG-fMRI, audio-video, and medical data), body sensor networking, and understanding various brain functions and disorders.  Overall, BCI is a valuable tool in biomedical research and rehabilitation, offering potential for improved diagnostics, treatment, and quality of life for those affected by neurological conditions.",signal processing machine learning sensor networks major tools biomedical data signal image patient peripheral information understanding recognition classification ccbi major research focus developing ground breaking approaches humancentred ai brain research looking functional personal behavioural psychological physiological disorders brain functional data signal eeg meg fmri joint eegfmri processing understanding machine learning brain responses various stimuli seizure dementia autism mental fatigue sleep pain depression mild cognitive impairment mci alzheimer braincomputer interfacing bci brain eeg hyperscanning mental physical rehabilitation rehabilitative assessment analysis processing learning human related data multimodal data analysis learning eegfmri audiovideo medical data body sensor networkingnncore services offer include,"Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) plays a significant role in biomedical research and rehabilitation by enabling direct communication between the brain and external devices.

ability detect becoming critical necessity ensure authenticity trustworthiness image data ai models even beaten humans art competitions," In the research on signature verification using machine learning, it was found that there are unique behaviors that differentiate human and robotic forgers. These differences include:  1. Robotic forgers tend to exhibit more consistent and uniform strokes compared to human forgers, who often vary their stroke patterns. 2. Human forgers may incorporate subtle errors or inconsistencies in their forgeries, while robotic forgeries are typically more precise and error-free. 3. Robotic forgers may struggle to replicate certain aspects of handwriting, such as pressure variations, slant, and curvature, which are easier for human forgers to imitate. 4. Robotic forgeries may also lack the natural flow and rhythm that is characteristic of human handwriting. 5. Robotic forgeries may leave telltale signs of the technology used, such as small inconsistencies or anomalies that would not be present in a genuine signature.  These findings suggest that a system trained solely on human forgeries could potentially be vulnerable to attack by robots, whereas a system designed to recognize both human and robotic forgeries would be more robust.",signature verification machine learning often employed detect real forged signatures however robotic arms generative models overcome systems mount falseacceptance attacks research results show exclusive behaviours human robotic forgers suggesting system trained wholly human forgeries easily attacked robots gain falsepositive verification results finetuning effective showing attacks prevented rather first consumer robotbased forgery crime committednn nnfall detection privacypreserving human behaviour monitoring thermal vision thermal sensor array tsa combination appropriate computational intelligence techniques used approach lowcost noncontact privacypreserving human behaviour monitoring,"Research in signature verification using machine learning has shown exclusive behaviours to human and robotic forgers.

eegfmri audiovideo medical data body sensor networking,"  Body sensor networking plays a significant role in Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) for identifying and stimulating brain epileptogenic networks. It involves the use of various sensors placed on the body to collect physiological data such as heart rate, skin conductance, and muscle activity. This data is then analyzed to identify patterns or anomalies that may indicate the presence of epileptic activity in the brain.  In the case of stimulation, these sensors can also be used to deliver electrical or magnetic stimuli to specific areas of the brain, potentially helping to control seizures or modify neural activity. This is particularly useful in the context of BCI, as it allows for non-invasive intervention and monitoring of brain activity.  At Nottingham Trent University's Interactive Systems Research Group, researchers are actively working on developing new adaptive and cooperative signal processing, model and data-driven AI, and single- or multi-channel, multi-dimensional, and multimodal biomedical signal decomposition methods for BCI and body sensor networking. These efforts aim to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of seizure identification and stimulation of brain epileptogenic networks.",group activity centred around brain research mainly brain computer interfacing bci including eeg hyperscanning body sensor networking bci body brain abnormality identification recently main interest seizure identification stimulation brain epileptogenic networks developing new adaptive cooperative signal processing model data driven ai single multichannel multidimensional multimodal biomedical signal decomposition group activity centred around brain research mainly brain computer interfacing bci including eeg hyperscanning body sensor networking bci body brain abnormality identification recently main interest seizure identification stimulation brain epileptogenic networks developing new adaptive cooperative signal processing model data driven ai single multichannel multidimensional multimodal biomedical,"Body Sensor Networking (BCI) plays a crucial role in Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) by enabling the identification and stimulation of brain epileptogenic networks.

subject talk get handson experience taster session visit subject hub chat academics current students,"  In an academic setting, lectures, seminars, and workshops serve different purposes. Lectures are typically large, formal presentations delivered by an academic, aimed at giving a broad overview of a topic and providing a framework for further study. They are usually held in lecture theaters or classrooms and can be intimidating for students who are not accustomed to this format.  On the other hand, seminars and workshops are smaller, interactive sessions where a group of students gather, often led by an academic, to debate and discuss specific topics in greater depth. These sessions offer opportunities for students to ask questions, share ideas, and engage in discussions. They are designed to be interactive and promote active learning.  Independent research is another essential aspect of higher education, where students are expected to conduct preparatory reading for most lectures and seminars, prepare coursework, and carry out independent study such as reading textbooks and lecture notes. Practical sessions and workshops may also be included, where students meet with their lecturers in small groups to discuss problems or work through challenging topics. The rest of their time is spent on independent study.  In summary, while lectures provide a broad overview of a topic, seminars and workshops facilitate deeper engagement and discussion, and independent research allows students to delve deeper into the subject matter on their own.",types learning lectures delivered academic held lecture theatres classrooms purpose lectures give framework structure learning around lecture theatres large overwhelming student used taught classroom setting seminars workshops smaller sessions group gets together led academic providing opportunity debate discuss learning designed interactive independent research students expected conduct preparatory reading lectures seminars preparing courseworkxa coursework vary essays portfolios include presentations group projects course tutors give advice write universitylevel coursework course induction sessions available advice course ntu great service offered library mentors help learn research write degree level,"The purpose of lectures in an academic setting is to provide a framework for structuring learning around.

At Nottingham Trent University (NTU), we offer a BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering, which includes both standard and foundation year options.  The foundation year is designed for students who don't have the necessary qualifications to start directly on a three-year undergraduate course. It provides a pathway into the full degree program, covering essential topics like mathematics, physics, and computer studies.  In terms of specific entry requirements, for the standard Software Engineering course, you usually need two subjects from Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computing, IT, or a related subject at A-Level or equivalent. For the foundation year, you would typically need five GCSEs including English and Maths at grade C or above, along with other relevant qualifications.  It's always best to check the most current information on our website or contact our admissions team for detailed guidance.","The academic qualifications required for a career in software engineering include a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Software Engineering, which can be obtained with or without completing a foundation year.

This means that students are often more responsible for identifying and seeking out the support they need. While schools may provide more structured support systems, universities offer a wider range of resources and services, such as disability support services, mental health counseling, and academic advising. However, many students may not be aware of these resources or feel uncomfortable asking for help due to stigma or fear of appearing weak. Additionally, some students may require more guidance and support in navigating these resources, particularly those with additional support needs. At NTU, our Student Support Services aim to bridge this gap by providing information, guidance, and advocacy to ensure that all students have the necessary support to succeed academically and personally.","At school, students may have had regular contact with a Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) and actively participated in deciding what support was needed.

However, at university, the approach to support is generally more self-directed. Students are encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning and wellbeing, although there is still support available.  At NTU, we have a dedicated Student Support Services team that offers a range of services to help students with disabilities. This includes academic support such as extended deadlines, alternative exam arrangements, and note-taking assistance. We also offer wellbeing support through our Counselling Service, Disability and Dyslexia Support, and Mental Health Advisors.  It's important to note that students are expected to self-identify any additional support needs they may have, and then engage with the relevant support services to discuss their requirements. This process may differ slightly depending on the specific disability or need, but the aim is always to provide tailored support to help students succeed in their studies.  We understand that this transition from school to university can be daunting, especially for those with disabilities. That's why we encourage parents and carers to get involved in discussions around support, and to work closely with their child throughout the process. We also offer workshops and events specifically designed to help students with disabilities prepare for university life, including information about the support available and how to access it.","The support provided at university differs from that at school in several ways, especially for students with disabilities.

They provide a suite of tools for building game worlds, characters, animations, and physics simulations.  3. Mobile Development: To create games for mobile devices, knowledge of the Android SDK (Software Development Kit) is crucial. This allows developers to build native Android applications and integrate them with game engines like Unity.  4. 3D Modeling and Texturing: Creating 3D game assets requires skills in modeling, texturing, and rigging. Tools such as Blender, Maya, or 3DS Max can be used to create these assets, while software like Substance Painter or ZBrush can help with texturing and detailing.  5. Virtual Reality (VR): Developing games for VR headsets like the Meta Quest3, Pico3, and Vive Pro Eye requires understanding of VR development principles and working with VR-specific APIs. This includes creating immersive environments, implementing motion controls, and optimizing performance for VR hardware.  6. Serious Games Design: Designing educational and serious games involves understanding learning theories, instructional design principles, and usability testing methodologies. This ensures that the games are effective in delivering their intended educational or training objectives.  7.

Sensor Networks: By equipping homes with sensor networks, the group aims to monitor system user behavior. This can help identify any potential issues or risks early on, allowing for timely interventions and support.  2. Assistive Solutions for Mild Cognitive Impairment: The group provides assistive solutions for individuals suffering from mild cognitive impairment. These solutions can help these individuals navigate their daily lives more easily and independently.  3. Assistive Robotics Application: The group also develops assistive robotics applications to aid in independent living. For example, robots could help with household chores, medication reminders, or even social interaction.  4. Psychological State Monitoring: The group monitors the psychological state of older adults. This can help identify signs of depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues, allowing for appropriate care and support.  5. Orientation Services: The group provides orientation services to help older adults navigate their environment. This can be particularly beneficial for those with cognitive impairments or those new to a care facility.  6. Care Improvement: By collecting and analyzing data from various sources, the group can provide insights that help improve the care provided to older adults. This could include improvements in care delivery, care planning, or care management strategies.","The CIA Research Group's focus on independent living for older adults can improve their lives by equipping homes with sensor networks to monitor user behavior, providing assistive solutions for patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment, and utilizing assistive robotics applications to aid in independent living.

Here are a few examples of industrial applications that demonstrate the use of computational intelligence:  1. Predictive Maintenance: Industries like manufacturing and transportation use predictive maintenance systems that utilize machine learning algorithms to forecast equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime and increasing efficiency.  2. Fraud Detection: Banks and financial institutions employ computational intelligence techniques such as neural networks and anomaly detection to identify fraudulent activities, protecting their customers' assets and maintaining trust.  3. Personalized Marketing: Companies use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, enabling them to deliver personalized marketing content and recommendations, enhancing customer engagement and sales.  4. Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars rely on computational intelligence for navigation, object recognition, and decision-making, making travel safer and more convenient.  5. Healthcare Diagnostics: In the medical field, AI can assist doctors in diagnosing diseases by analyzing medical images or patient data, helping to improve accuracy and reduce diagnostic errors.  6. Smart Cities: Urban planning and management can benefit from computational intelligence through traffic prediction, energy consumption optimization, and waste management solutions, leading to more sustainable and efficient cities.","Some examples of real-world industrial applications demonstrating the use of computational intelligence include predictive maintenance in manufacturing, where AI algorithms forecast equipment failures to prevent downtimes; supply chain optimization, using machine learning to improve logistics and inventory management; personalized medicine, employing data analysis for tailored treatment plans; autonomous vehicles that rely on computer vision and decision-making algorithms; and financial market analysis, utilizing AI for high-frequency trading strategies.",simple,"[{'source': 'CS_OpenDay_General.docx', 'filename': 'CS_OpenDay_General.docx'}]",True,0.0,0.8,

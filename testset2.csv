"What hands-on learning opportunities are available in the Human Interactive Technology Laboratory for students enrolled in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Games Tech, and Computing programs?

Output: The question seeks to understand the practical experiences provided by the Human Interactive Technology Laboratory specifically tailored for students from various disciplines such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, Games Tech, and Computing. It aims to identify the types of activities or projects that these students can engage in within this laboratory setting.


context: ""The University's Department of Computer Science offers an extensive range of courses covering topics from algorithms and data structures to artificial intelligence and machine learning.""
question: ""What are some examples of AI-related courses offered by the department?""
feedback: The question is clear in asking for AI-related course examples but lacks specificity. It does not mention any particular level (undergraduate, graduate) or whether it's looking for introductive or advanced courses. To improve clarity and answerability, the question could specify the academic level of interest and whether it seeks a broad overview or detailed course descriptions.
